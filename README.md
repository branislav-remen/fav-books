# FavBooks - A Favorite Books Management App

Simple web application to manage favourite books.
Using React, Typescript, Redux (legacy), SASS and React hook form.
Github Copilot was used to help with: 
- writing comments
- commit messages

## Disclaimer

1. I am not a professional designer. The UI is simple and basic, focusing on the functionality.
2. Code style used in this project is my personal preference. I understand that different teams have different coding standards.
3. I do not have a strong experience with Material-UI, so there is for sure better/different ways how to use it.

## TODO:

- [x] Implement simple UI (responsive; using sass and components library)
- [x] Implement Redux store to save books (simple data)
- [x] Implement Form to save new book with validations (simple data)
- [ ] Add support for image upload
- [ ] Implement detail view for book (in modal window)
- [ ] Implement search feature

## Nice to have (future improvement, features not mentioned in web app description):
- add PostCSS, Autoprefixer
- create theme and move hardcoded values there 
- move code from App to "pages" folder if more pages are added
- add tests (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright)
